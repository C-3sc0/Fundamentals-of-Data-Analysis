# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis

Author: Francesco Troja

This repository serves as a key resource for the project and task assignments of the **HDip in Computing within ATU University's Data Analytics program**, specifically for the **Fundamentals of Data Analytics** module. It contains two *Jupyter notebooks* named `tasks.ipynb` and `project.ipynb`, which encapsulate detailed analyses, and supplementary visualizations stored in 2 plot folders named `plots` and `Project-plots`.

## Task Problem Statement

Throughout the course, five distinct tasks were selected and executed, each addressing specific aspects and challenges:

- **Task 1**: This task centered around the exploration of the **Collatz Conjecture**, specifically verifying its validity for the first 10,000 positive integers.
- **Task 2**: It involved an in-depth analysis of the **Palmer Penguins dataset**. The primary focus was on providing an *initial overview* of the dataset and elucidating the various *types of variables* it encompasses.
- **Task 3**: Building upon the exploration of the penguin dataset, another aspect of Task 3 concentrated on determining the most suitable **probability distribution** for each variable within the dataset.
- **Task 4**: Task 4 shifted attention to the calculation of **entropy**. Specifically, it involved determining the *entropy of the total number of heads versus tails when two coins are flipped simultaneously*.
- **Task 5**: Concluding the series of tasks, Task 5 revisited the Penguin dataset, prompting the generation of *individual plots* for each variable in the dataset.

Each task presented unique challenges and opportunities for exploration, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of various concepts and methodologies.

## Project Problem Statement

The **project** centers on the exploration and analysis of the well-known **Iris dataset**. It aims to comprehensively *investigate* the dataset's *variables* and *individual data points*. The focus is on categorizing each variable based on common variable types and measurement scales found in mathematics, statistics, and Python. It includes the *selection*, *demonstration*, and *explanation* of suitable *summary statistics* to describe each variable effectively. Furthermore, it delves into identifying and illustrating the most appropriate plots tailored to visualize the characteristics of each variable effectively.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes **Python 3** as its primary technology stack. To execute the code within the Jupyter Notebook, it's essential to have Python 3 or a higher version installed. The official Python package can be obtained from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for download and installation. The utilization of Python 3 ensures compatibility with an extensive array of libraries and tools.
The libraries employed in the current notebook include:

- Pandas (The documentation can be found in the following link: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/));
- Matplotlib (The documentation can be found in the following link: [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html));
- Numpy (The documentation can be found in the following link: [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/));
- Seaborn (The documentation can be found in the following link: [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/));

The majority of the required libraries are typically pre-installed in the Python environment. In cases where a library is not present, the `pip command``, serving as the Python package installer, can be employed. To facilitate the installation process, open the terminal and execute the following command:

```python
pip install library_name
```

It's important to substitute "library_name" with the actual name of the library intended for installation.

## References

In the notebook, references are appropriately cited within the sections where they're utilized and compiled at the end. While some references might not be directly applied in the notebook, they were consulted to enhance comprehension of the related topics covered.
