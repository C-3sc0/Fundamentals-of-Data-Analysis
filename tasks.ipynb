    "The **Collatz Conjecture**, first proposed by mathematician *Lothar Collatz* in 1937, is a well-known unresolved mathematical issue. Over the years, it has been labelled the \"**3n + 1 problem**,\" the \"**Ulam conjecture**\" (in honor of Stanislaw Ulam), and the \"**Syracuse problem**.\" The Collatz Conjecture has attracted the attention and interest of various researchers, each of whom has contributed to its study, promotion, or discussion.

    "3. Statement of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Collatz Conjecture** focuses on sequences that commence with any *positive integer*. It states that when we commence with a positive integer, denoted as **$x$**, each successive term is determined by the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the number is **even**, divide it by two (*$\\frac{x}{2}$*)\n",
    "- If the number is **odd**, multiple it by three and add one (*$3x+1$*)\n",
    "\n",
    "The conjecture suggests that irrespective of the initial positive integer chosen and the application of these rules, the sequence of numbers generated will eventually reach the value **$1$**.\n",
    "Although this assertion has been demonstrated to be true for a wide range of starting values, including very large ones, it remains unproven whether the conjecture holds for all positive integers or if there exists a counterexample. As a result, the ultimate validity or invalidity of the Collatz Conjecture remains an unsolved question in mathematics [2](https://testbook.com/maths/collatz-conjecture 'Conjecture: Importance and History of Collatz Conjecture').\n"
